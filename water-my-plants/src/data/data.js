      "303 OG Kush is a strain with various sources of origin. Below are several anecdotes about the strain's inception. \r\n\r\nOrigin #1\r\n303 OG, also called 303 Kush or 303 OG Kush, is reported to have first been cultivated in Colorado by the breeder known as Zombo and is an Indica-dominant cross between a Pre-'98 Bubba Kush and Reservoir ChemDawg IC3.\r\n\r\nReported by online sources to have been selected for its phenotypes by Colorado’s Hill Billy, the strain was named after Denver’s area code. Clones are the best option for cultivators looking to grow 303 OG, as seeds are not easily obtained.\r\n\r\nOrigin #2\r\nThe 303 OG grown by The Clinic in Colorado is an Indica-dominant cross between Kosher Kush and Ghost OG. Available throughout Colorado, flowers from The Clinic’s 303 OG strain provides a sweet and spicy flavor profile that’s popular for its OG characteristics, powerful body high, and cerebral effects.\r\n\r\nThe Clinic’s 303 OG Nug Run Sugar Budder won first place in 2014 for Best U.S. Concentrates at the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup. The Clinic’s 303 OG THC content has been tested as high as 20%, and the strain reportedly helps mitigate physical discomfort, apprehension, insomnia, and loss of appetite.\r\n",

      "While the original breeder of 3 Kings is unknown, the lineage of this sativa-leaning hybrid is made up of Headband, Sour Diesel, and OG Kush, three strains often crowned as royalty by the cannabis community. Available from several online seed banks, 3 Kings reportedly carries a tangy and sour aroma and moderate THC levels of about 16%.\r\n\r\nThree Kings grows to a medium height, yielding moderate amounts of pale green colas glistening with frosty trichomes in an eight-to-nine-week flowering period. This strain is suitable for indoor or outdoor growing conditions, but is said to require some experience to properly manage.\r\n\r\nGrowers should expect 3 Kings seeds to harvest up to 600 grams per square meter indoors and up to 650 grams per plant outside. Some sources also suggest that certain samples of 3 Kings have tested for high levels of cannabichromene (CBC), a cannabinoid that has purported anti-inflammatory properties.",
